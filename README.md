> Languorem Alpha Releases and Patch Notes

Hey! My name is [James](https://github.com/jrkienle) and I'm the developer of Languorem! In this wonderful GitHub repository you'll find alpha builds for the game (until it gets into Early Access on steam). Here is also where you can report bugs that you might encounter while testing! It's a win-win for both of us: you get to play the game for free, and I get to know what's wrong with it!
